- [✓] Obtain repo in BBVA's GitHub org (request to LEGAL dept.)
- [✓] git filter-branch pancho's email
- [✓] Add legal headers to code files
- [ ] Move repo to BBVA's
- [✓] Build a static release and publish it (this enables us to show it around)
- [✓] Integrate tool with Patton
- [ ] Document usage so that we can communicate with Ubuntu
- [ ] Contact Ubuntu and introduce the prj to them
- [ ] Cleanup: Move things around to improve readability
- [✓] Cleanup: purge unused code from the PoC
- [✓] Build a pipeline to build the tool
- [ ] Build a pipeline for publishing GENERIC and any other release
- [ ] Implement Sources section
- [ ] Implement CVSS parser and maybe contribute it to the Haskell community
- [ ] Try to ensure a smooth out-of-the-box experience for ubuntu users of Debsecan (possibly requesting Ubuntu with a PR)
- [ ] Profit!

# Possible Adoption by the Community
## Ideal Scenario
- Ubuntu adopts this trasformer and integrates it into its security pipeline to
  produce the required databases.

- Debian accepts a patch to debsecan to compatibilize it with Ubuntu (involving
  the use of lsb_release -si, which is installed as a transitive dependency of
  debsecan).

This scenario seems quite future-proof to us.


## Suboptimal Scenario #1
- Debian does not accept our changes to debsecan
 - Ubuntu accepts our patch to debsecan
   No harm done. Essentially, we are virtually on the ideal scenario.
 - Ubuntu does not accept our patch to debsecan
   Unlikely.  They have a decade-old issue¹ still open.

## Suboptimal Scenario #2
- Ubuntu does not accept this converter nor enhancing their pipeline with it
  In this case we would provide a container with the necessary elements to
  produce the report ourselves.
